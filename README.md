Manchester Encoding
===================
Overview and Usage
------------------
This is a python program that converts an input string to [Manchester encoded][1] binary output, built as a class project for Fundamentals of Data Communications.

It requires the python programming language: Python 2.7 (http://python.org/download/), and the Tkinter Library (bundled with python by default).

The program can be run by passing the regex as a command line argument: `python manchesterEncoding.py`

You may get a 'command not found' error in Windows, which means python is not in your PATH. Check out how to add python to your path here: http://superuser.com/questions/143119/how-to-add-python-to-the-windows-path

Checkout the included screenshots. The GUI can improve, but it gets the work done :)
